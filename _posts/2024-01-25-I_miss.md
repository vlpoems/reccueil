## I miss

I miss waking up by your side  
Your fingers in my hand  
I miss discovering world with you  
Your forehead on my lips  

Every day i wake up dreaming about a message of yours  
Every day i wake up, dreaming about us  
Every day i wake up, I miss these days  
Every day i wake up, getting further from you hurts my soul  

I want to punch the old me in the face  
Wasting everything that meant something to me  
Trust the process they say  

I wonder what's in your head at the moment  
Are you still fighting this demon i created  
I wonder what you're thinking of me  
I wonder, as it is all i can do  

I swear i still want your happiness  
I swear everything i did wrong was a mistake  
I swear i sound like these fuckers i hate  
I swear i'm so angry at me  

Whatever, wish you the best  
Whatever the date, whatever the era  
I'll always be ready to keep trying  
Give you the best life you'll ever have
